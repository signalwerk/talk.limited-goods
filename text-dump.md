**what users want and what servers want**

3.6.2021 · Stefan Huber





**Aim of this talk**

– It’s **about basics** – not about a showcase

– Just a couple of **thoughts** from a developer…

– I wanted a **vaccination**





**What is the Problem?**





**Limitation of goods**

– **Supply** is not endless – COVID-19 vaccination

– Outer **restrictions** – room is full (conserts)





**Limitations of the servers**

– Too less server **resources**

– Too many **users/requests**





**What people want**





**Give it to me!**

– They want it

– **They want it! Now!**

– No reload/wait/get screwed

– They probably **get mad** at you if they don’t get it





**What is the problem**

**with the servers?**





**Spikes**





**Two kinds of spikes**

– Unplanned

– Planned





**Unplanned spikes**

– «Evening News»

– «Go viral»

If the spike comes to quick you don’t have a chance to

start servers… Though luck…

Once down; people hammer reload…





**Planned spikes**

– **Open the Gates** – Black Friday

– **Gates get opened** – Newsletters/Articles/Strategy





**If you don’t…**





**Black Friday**

Digitec 2019

**Spikes – not only your system**

**What’s the problem**

**with traffic?**





**«Cheap» traffic**





**«Expensive» traffic**





**Who generates traffic?**





**It’s not only users...**

– Users

– Rotbots/Scraper

– API





**«Strategies» to avoid**

**expensive traffic**





**Gates**





**F###-up in Zurich**





**When is it gone?**





**You will be «sold out» soon...**





**You have to chancel orders...**





**What is fair?**





**First come – first serve?**

– We live in a global world and people sleep

– Some people work with hands

– People usually don’t wait for your drop





**What’s the solution?**





**I don’t know…**





**Technical excellence**

– Avoid dynamic content

– Cache cache cache…





**Strategies to avoid**

**spikes**





**Simple tricks**

– **Start** your **servers** early

– Newsletter spread over time

– **Know your clients** and products

Freitag doesn’t sell black bags in the online-store.

Causes too much traffic/request.





**Other tricks**

– **Lottery** – it’s «fair» for everyone (register at any time)

→ you will get robots…

– Automate **waiting lists**!

– Voucher systems (other sellers?)

Example: People who got in get a voucher and can invite

other people (chain of trust) – Fair?





**Look forward to better**

**solutions.**

Thank you
